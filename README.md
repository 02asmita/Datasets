Machine Learning Datasets
=========================

This repository contains a copy of machine learning datasets used in tutorials on MachineLearningMastery.com.

This repository was created to ensure that the datasets used in tutorials remain available and are not dependent upon unreliable third parties.

In many cases, tutorials will link directly to the raw dataset URL, therefore dataset filenames should not be changed once added to the repository.
